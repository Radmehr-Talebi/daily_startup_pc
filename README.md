# daily_startup_pc
a batch code for startup your day with a cowboy that save your word of the day in a txt file

so wherever you place WordOFTheDay.txt file make sure to change the path  echo %date% - %wordofday% >> "C:\Users\ASUS\Desktop\WordOFTheDay.txt"   on line 39 of the code by editing it by notepad.
do the same thing for line 46 and start wmplayer.exe ""C:\Users\ASUS\Desktop\howdy-partner.mp3""      EZ I guess
for running it everytime you log in to your PC make sure to place daily.bat file in C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup  obviously you shloud change Username with your actual username.  XD





HAVE FUN!
